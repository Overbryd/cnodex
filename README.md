# Cnodex -> Nodex

Attention: This project has been renamed and moved to [Nodex](https://github.com/Overbryd/nodex).

If you want to learn and use the helper modules for **distributed Elixir** and **c-nodes**, please
have a look at **nodex**.

I felt this is a much better name, and namespace to house these modules.

Thank you!
